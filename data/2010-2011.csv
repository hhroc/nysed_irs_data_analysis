"***In a small number of incidents, a school's School Violence Index (SVI) may have been adjusted as a result of a VADIR reconciliation and/or Weighted Incident Exclusion Process (WIEP). The SVI is comparative measure of the level of violence in a school.  The SVI is computed in accordance with a formula established by the Commissioner that takes into account the enrollment of the school and is weighted to reflect the most serious violent incidents.  The VADIR reconciliation is a multi-step process that it used to ensure that VADIR data submitted by the school is accurate. The WIEP is the process by which a school district demonstrates to SED that one or more of its schools should not be designated as persistently dangerous because some or all of the violent incidents it reported on the Violent and Disruptive Incident Report (VADIR) summary form were allegedly directly related to a student offender's disability.  There are also additional WIEP requirements that a school district must satisfy before SED will adjust a school's SVI.  More information regarding the VADIR reconciliation and/or WIEP is available upon request.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
